        <p>Harry James Evans Potter (b. 31 July 1980) was an English half-blood wizard, 
        and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. The only child and son of James and Lily Potter (née Evans),
        Harry's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself or Neville Longbottom as the one with 
        the power to vanquish Lord Voldemort, one of the most powerful and feared Dark wizards in the world. 
        After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy of Severus Snape, 
        Harry was chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord. 
        This in turn caused the Potter family to go into hiding.</p>
